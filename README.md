## Instructions
---------------

* Fork this repo by clicking on the Fork icon to the far right to your
  github account
* Clone the forked repo (i.e from your account and not this) to your
  machine
* In the master branch create a folder with your name (e.g santoshs) and
  then add your solution in a language of your choice (JS, Ruby, Java
etc)
* Once you have done that and ready with a solution, raise a pull
  request to my repo
* All solutions should have unit tests (or specs) without which they
  will not be merged back to the repo.
* The challenge should be completed by Monday 7th November 2016. Pull
  requests raised after that will not be considered

Good Luck
